ENCE are through to the playoffs at Elisa Masters Espoo after beating GamerLegion 2-1 in Group A's decider match. They are now set for a collision course against Apeks, Jakub "⁠kuben⁠" Gurczynski's former team, in the semi-final stage of the $200,000 tournament.

The local favorites drew first blood in the series with a convincing win on their map pick of Ancient. After the first half ended with a 6-6 stalemate, ENCE took control of the game on the CT side and dropped just two rounds en route to a 13-8 victory, with Guy "⁠NertZ⁠" Iluz posting a 1.65 rating.

Lukas "⁠gla1ve⁠" Rossander's side began Overpass the brighter of the two teams, racing to a 3-0 lead, but then GamerLegion’s offense came alive. With Frederik "⁠acoR⁠" Gyldstrand leading the charge, they won eight of the final nine rounds of the half, and they followed it up with a 5-0 run on the CT side to put the map to bed.

NertZ was back to his dominant best in the early stages of Nuke, racking up 13 frags as ENCE stormed to a 6-0 lead. Janusz "⁠Snax⁠" Pogorzelski and Nicolas "⁠Keoz⁠" Dgus then came to GamerLegion's rescue and helped the team keep their opponents at bay for the remainder of the half, which ended with all square.

But just like on Ancient, the second half was all about ENCE's water-tight defense. They won six rounds in a row to hit series point before wrapping the game up shortly afterward thanks to two key frags from gla1ve on the lower site.
