How to Store Homemade Meatballs
If you have any leftover meatballs, we’d recommend storing them in the fridge for a maximum of 3 days. To store in the freezer, place cooked and cooled meatballs on an ungreased cookie sheet. Freeze uncovered about 20 minutes or until firm. Place partially frozen meatballs in heavy plastic bag or freezer container. Seal, label and freeze no longer than 3 months. Keep some on hand for last-minute dinner creations!
