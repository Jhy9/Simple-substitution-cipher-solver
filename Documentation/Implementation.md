# Implementation


## Dictionary
Program has a dictionary as a textfile that gets turned into a trie during runtime. Each node in trie contains an array of children which depict the next letters and a boolean that tells whether or not the node 
is an ending for a word.

### Complexities: 
Time:  
Adding word into dictionary: O(n) where n is amount of letters in the word.  
Searching dictionary for a word: O(n) where n is the amount of letters in searched word.


Space complexity of trie is O(n) where n is the word count of dictionary.
