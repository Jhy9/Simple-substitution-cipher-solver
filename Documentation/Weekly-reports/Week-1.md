# Week 1
## What has been done?
This week I created the project, decided on the solvable problem and made rough plans on algorithm that should be solving it. I also wrote project specification based on my thoughts.

## What next?
Next week I'm going begin writing the algorithm starting from trie for dictionary and then moving on from there.

Time used: around 6 hours
