# Week 4

## What was done?
- Designed the complete algorithm that should solve the problem
- (Mostly) completed the algorithm implementation
- Began writing the design document

## What next?
Currently all of the parts that algorithm needs to work are programmed in there. However the program is untested and very likely in a broken state.

Goals for the next week are:

1. Fix the program to a working state and add relevant commenting to code
2. Add unit tests to relevant classes and methods
3. Begin testing the problem solving ability and adjust program if needed
4. Complete design documentation on implementatiton


### Time used: around 13 hours
