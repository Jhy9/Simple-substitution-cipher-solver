# Week 6

## What was done?
- Wrote discussion about first set of [tests](./Test-Log-Discussion.md)
- Tweaked algorithm so that now it dynamically increases acceptance threshold instead of being static
- Wrote some unit tests and wrote coverage report


## What next?
Next it is time to do a new set of tests to determine how effective change is. Preliminary tests showed that results were quite good but unfortunately I'm currently 
sick so proper tests have to be left for next week.
UI is still needed. Will try to get some sort of simple graphic ui which shows translated texts done by demo sessions.
More unit testing still needed. Will have to do some refactoring to be able to properly test some things so this will probably be last priority.

### Time used : 13 hours
