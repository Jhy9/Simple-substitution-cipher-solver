# Week 2

## What was done?
I didn't get much done this week. I mainly managed to create first implementation for tries. Also been trying to map out the structure for program. 

## Problems
Main problem so far has been trying to figure out how I want the program to function outside of the main algorithm. Also not having used Java in a while is slowing down progress a bit as I need to look up a lot of things.

I think it is very likely that storing children nodes in arraylist will not be optimal in terms of speed. 
Will later on change the implementation to use arrays which should greatly improve speed at the cost of some extra space.

Time used: around 7 hours

## What is next?
For next week I will try to get first version of program to executable state. Will also need to write tests for the program.
