# Week 3

## What was done?
- Established program structure
- Found dictionary and integrated it into the program
- Started writing unittests
- Rewrote node to use array instead of arraylist
- Created some methods for cipher handling

## Problems
Still a bit behind the schedule but I feel that I made at least some overall progress this week.

## What next?
Next weeks goal is to create the part of algorithm that that handles letter substitutions. Comments are still lacking 
and unit testing is not finished so those things also need to be taken care of. 

## Time used
Around 12 hours.
