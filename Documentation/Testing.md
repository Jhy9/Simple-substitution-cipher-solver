# Testing 

This document describes different types of testing done with the algorithm.

## Unittests and coverage

Unittest coverage can be found here 
[![codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/Jhy9/Simple-substitution-cipher-solver/graph/badge.svg?token=QXV5FMENMK)](https://codecov.io/gh/Jhy9/Simple-substitution-cipher-solver)  
GUI and solution writing were not tested within unittests. 

## Mid-development testing
Two sets of tests were done mid-development to observe algorithms functionality and to find potential improvements for algorithm.

Discussion for initial testing can be found [here](Test-initial-discussion.md).  
Discussion for acceptance threshold testing can be found [here](Test-athcomparison-discussion.md)


## Final performance test
Performance test was done with final version of program results of which can be found [here](Logs/Test-final-logs.md). These test results don't have a discussion.

## Testfiles
All testfiles used in final performance test and mid-development testing can be found in folder [textsfortesting](../src/main/resources/TextsForTesting) and are readily usable by program.
