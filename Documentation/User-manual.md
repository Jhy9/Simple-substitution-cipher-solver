# User manual

## Setting up

## Using program

After text has been deciphered, it can be found in folder src/main/resources/Output. 

## Text files
Users can add their own textfiles for testing or deciphering. Files should be in English and have preferably at least 50 words (as program may not be able to decipher shorted texts).  
File should also be in .txt format. Other file types may work but haven't been tested.  
If your file is not ciphered, put it into folder src/main/resources/TextsForTesting . If your file is already in ciphered form, put it into folder src/main/resources/Input.
