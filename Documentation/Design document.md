## Algorithm
Algorithm works solves substitution ciphers by forming a translating array in following steps.

### 1. Initial guess
<b>Inital guess: Ciphered text has the same letter distribution as dictionary. </b>

Therefore we get a starting point by calculating letter frequencies of both the used dictionary and the cipher. We then set the translating array in a way that the most common letter in cipher is translated 
as most common letter in dictionary and so on.
